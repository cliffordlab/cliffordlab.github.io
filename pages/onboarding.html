## Want to join the lab?

If you are a student or postdoc interested in joining the Clifford Lab:

1. Read Gari's [ethics and expectations](http://gdclifford.info/ethics).
2. Send your CV, transcripts, funding situation, and research interests to Gari (`gari AT gatech.edu`).
3. If you are already at Emory or GT and want to request a 30-min chat, email Cathy Keeler (`ckeeler AT emory.edu`) who will help arrange a meeting.

## Building access

Our office at HSRB requires keycard access.

First, get your Emory ID card from the Emory card office.

Once you have your card, email Leita Young (`lkyoung AT emory.edu`) to request to have building access granted to your card.

## Roster

This is so we all have each other's contact information.

Ask Erik Reinertsen (`erikrtn AT gmail.com`) for an invitation to our lab roster Google Spreadsheet, then add your info.

## Slack

Some of our group communicates with [Slack](http://slack.com). Ask anyone in the lab to invite you to the team.

## BMI listserv

The BMI Department stays in touch with everyone via email listserv.

Navigate to [listserv.cc.emory.edu](http://listserv.cc.emory.edu) and log in.

Under "unlisted lists", search for `cci-students`.

Select that listserv and click subscribe.

## Journal Club

Students and postdocs attend and present at our journal club.

Check out the [website](http://nematilab.info/bmijc/), which also explains how to sign up to present. You must do so once per semester.

## Google Calendars

We have a `Clifford Lab Calendar` for putting in your holidays/absences, or key meetings in the group. 

We also have a `BMI Talks` calendar for seminars.

Feel free to share your personal calendar with Gari (but not the whole group) if you have a particularly complex schedule.
