	abstract={Photoplethysmography is a key sensing technology which is used in wearable devices such as smartwatches and fitness trackers. Currently, photoplethysmography sensors are used to monitor physiological parameters including heart rate and heart rhythm, and to track activities like sleep and exercise. Yet, wearable photoplethysmography has potential to provide much more information on health and wellbeing, which could inform clinical decision making. This Roadmap outlines directions for research and development to realise the full potential of wearable photoplethysmography. Experts discuss key topics within the areas of sensor design, signal processing, clinical applications, and research directions. Their perspectives provide valuable guidance to researchers developing wearable photoplethysmography technology.}

  abstract={Objective: To develop a robust heart rate (HR) estimation method based on the HR estimates derived from multiple electrocardiogram (ECG) leads from intensive care patients. Methods: Heart rate was obtained by an open source QRS detection algorithm. Physiological signal quality indices (SQI) were obtained by analyzing the morphological and statistical characteristics of each waveform and their relationships. Robust HR estimation was obtained by a Kalman filter based upon the SQI adjustment. The state of Kalman filter could be adjusted by the innovation of Kalman filter and the SQI of ECG data. This method was evaluated using more than 6000 hours of simultaneously acquired ECG from a 437 patient subset of the Multi-Parameter Intelligent Monitoring for Intensive Care II database and adding real ECG noise. Results: Compared with other heart rate estimation methods such as the direct estimation or sample and hold method, this method has the smallest root mean square error (rMSE) of heart rate estimation even when high levels of persistent noise occur. Conclusion: This algorithm provides an accurate HR estimation even in the presence of high levels of persistent noise and artifact.},

abstract="Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH), an advanced stage of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) causes liver inflammation and can lead to cirrhosis. In this paper, we present a deep learning approach to identify patients at risk of developing NASH, given that they are suffering from NAFLD. For this, we created two sub cohorts within NASH (NASH suspected (NASH-S) and NASH biopsy-confirmed (NASH-B)) based on the availability of liver biopsy tests. We utilized medical codes from patient electronic medical records and augmented it with patient demographics to build a long short-term memory based NASH vs. NAFLD classifier. The model was trained and tested using five-fold cross-validation and compared with baseline models including XGBoost, random forest and logistic regression. An out-of-sample area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.61 was achieved in classifying NASH patients from NAFLD. When the same model was used to classify out-of-sample NASH-B cohort from NAFLD patients, a highest AUPRC of 0.53 was achieved which was better than other baseline methods.",
