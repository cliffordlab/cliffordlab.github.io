				<p>Dr. Gari Clifford is a tenured Professor of Biomedical Informatics and Biomedical Engineering at
					Emory University and the Georgia Institute of Technology, and the Chair of the Department of
					Biomedical Informatics (BMI) at Emory. His research focuses on the application of signal processing
					and machine learning to medicine to classify, track and predict health and illness. His focus
					research areas include critical care, digital psychiatry, global health, mHealth, neuroinformatics
					and perinatal health. After training in Theoretical Physics, he transitioned to AI and Engineering
					for his doctorate (DPhil) at the University of Oxford in the 1990â€™s. He subsequently joined MIT as a
					postdoctoral fellow, then Principal Research Scientist where he managed the creation of the MIMIC II
					database, the largest open access critical care database in the world. He later returned as an
					Associate Professor of Biomedical Engineering to Oxford, where he helped found its Sleep & Circadian
					Neuroscience Institute and served as Director of the Centre for Doctoral Training in Healthcare
					Innovation at the Oxford Institute of Biomedical Engineering. As Chair, Dr Clifford has established
					BMI as a leading center for critical care and mHealth informatics, and as a champion for open access
					data and open source software in medicine, particularly through his leadership of the <a
						href="https://physionet.org/challenge/>" target="_blank">PhysioNet/CinC Challenges</a> and
					contributions to the <a href="https://physionet.org/">PhysioNet Resource</a>. Despite this, he is a
					strong supporter of commercial translation, working closely with industry, and serves as CTO of
					MindChild Medical, a spin out from his research at MIT.</p>
