Dr. Gari Clifford is a tenured Professor of Biomedical Informatics and
Biomedical Engineering at Emory University and the Georgia Institute of
Technology, and the Chair of the Department of Biomedical Informatics (BMI) at
Emory. His research focuses on the application of signal processing and machine
learning to medicine to classify, track and predict health and illness. His
focus research areas include critical care, digital psychiatry, global health,
mHealth, neuroinformatics and perinatal health. After training in Theoretical
Physics, he transitioned to AI and Engineering for his doctorate (DPhil) at the
University of Oxford in the 1990â€™s. He subsequently joined MIT as a
postdoctoral fellow, then Principal Research Scientist where he managed the
creation of the MIMIC II database, the largest open access critical care
database in the world. He later returned as an Associate Professor of
Biomedical Engineering to Oxford, where he helped found its Sleep & Circadian
Neuroscience Institute and served as Director of the Centre for Doctoral
Training in Healthcare Innovation at the Oxford Institute of Biomedical
Engineering. As Chair, Dr Clifford has established BMI as a leading center for
critical care and mHealth informatics, and as a champion for open access data
and open source software in medicine, particularly through his leadership of
the [PhysioNet/CinC Challenges](https://moody-challenge.physionet.org) and contributions to the PhysioNet Resource.
Despite this, he is a strong supporter of commercial translation, working
closely with industry, and serves as CTO of MindChild Medical, a spin out from
his research at MIT.
