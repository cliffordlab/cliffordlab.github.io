Dr. Gari Clifford is a tenured Professor of Biomedical Informatics and 
Biomedical Engineering at Emory University and the Georgia Institute 
of Technology, and the Chair of the Department of Biomedical Informatics 
(BMI) at Emory. He develops signal processing and machine learning 
techniques to classify, track and predict health and illness in critical 
care, digital psychiatry, global health, mHealth, neuroinformatics and 
perinatal health.  After training in Theoretical Physics, he transitioned 
to AI and Engineering for his doctorate at the University of Oxford in 
the 1990â€™s. He subsequently joined MIT as a postdoctoral fellow, then 
Principal Research Scientist where he managed the creation of the 
MIMIC II database, the largest open-access critical care database in 
the world. He later returned to Oxford as an Associate Professor of 
Biomedical Engineering, where he helped found the Sleep & Circadian 
Neuroscience Institute and served as Director of the Centre for Doctoral 
Training in Healthcare Innovation at the Oxford Institute of Biomedical 
Engineering. Dr Clifford has a history of commercial translation, 
working closely with industry as an advisor to multiple companies, 
co-founding and serving as CTO of an MIT fetal monitoring spin-out 
(MindChild Medical) since 2009.  Dr. Clifford was elected as a Fellow of 
the IEEE for contributions to machine learning applications in 
cardiovascular time series in 2003. 
Dr Clifford is also a strong supporter of open-access data and open-source 
software in medicine, particularly through his leadership of the 
[PhysioNet/CinC Challenges](https://physionetchallenges.org) and contributions to the PhysioNet Resource over 
the last 25 years. Dr Clifford has a specific interest in working with 
marginalized communities, particularly in Central America where he works 
with his anthropologist partner, Prof. Rachel Hall-Clifford, and with 
whom he co-founded the [Co-design Lab for Health Equity](https://codesign.emory.edu/) and 
[Safe+Natal](https://safenatal.org).
