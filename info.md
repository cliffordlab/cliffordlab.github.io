## Contacting BMI

If you wish to get in touch with Prof. Clifford please email him (`gari AT gatech.edu`) and ensure you cc the BMI admin (`bmi-admin AT emory.edu`) who will help arrange a meeting. If you do not cc the admin your email may go into the void.


# Onboarding

Everyone joining the Clifford Lab has a few logistical to-dos.

## Want to join the lab?

If you are a student or postdoc interested in joining the Clifford Lab:

1. Read Gari's [ethics and expectations](http://gdclifford.info/ethics).
2. Send your CV, transcripts, funding situation, and research interests to Gari (`gari AT gatech.edu`).
3. If you are already at Emory or GT and want to request a 30-min chat, email the admin (`bmi-admin AT emory.edu`) who will help arrange a meeting.

[Job Opportunities](http://gdclifford.info/jobs)

## Access to Building

Our office at HSRB requires keycard access.

First, get your Emory ID card from the Emory card office.

Once you have your card, email Leita Young (`lkyoung AT emory.edu`) to request to have building access granted to your card.

## Roster

This is so we all have each other's contact information.

Ask Erik Reinertsen (`erikrtn AT gmail.com`) for an invitation to our lab roster Google Spreadsheet, then add your info.

## Slack

Some of our group communicates with [Slack](http://slack.com). Ask anyone in the lab to invite you to the team.

## BMI listserv

The BMI Department stays in touch with everyone via email listserv.

Navigate to [listserv.cc.emory.edu](http://listserv.cc.emory.edu) and log in.

Under "unlisted lists", search for `cci-students`.

Select that listserv and click subscribe.

## Journal Club

Students and postdocs attend and present at our journal club.

Check out the [website](http://nematilab.info/bmijc/), which also explains how to sign up to present. You must do so once per semester.

## Google Calendars

We have a `Clifford Lab Calendar` for putting in your holidays/absences, or key meetings in the group.

We also have a `BMI Talks` calendar for seminars.

Feel free to share your personal calendar with Gari (but not the whole group) if you have a particularly complex schedule.

## Self Organization

Perhaps the most important thing in terms of organizing your research is how and where you store all the code, data and information you create. Here's is my basic guide:
1. Code - store in a private repo on github under clifford lab. Default license is BSD.
2. Lab diary (see below) - Google Docs, shared with me
3. Data - beast:/data/... (this is not something you usually create) ... it will soon be mirrored in a synchronised way to a mounted drive on the cluster.
4. Processed data you generate but is not the original data: your home directory on any BMI machine. This is also mirrored on a mounted drive on the cluster. If it's on your laptop, then use Box or OneDrive to back it up if you have to. The key point here is that no-one but you should have access to this processed data - partially because it may contain PHI, but also because it must be fully regenerable by your code (in github) applied to the fixed original data. When you start to share copies of the data that have been transformed, filtered or altered in some way, the research ceases to be replicable and scientific repeatability is lost. Your research becomes essentially useless and the next person will have to do it all from scratch. This happens in the majority of cases and is a constant source of frustration to the entire scientific community.
5. Academic papers / thesis etc - use Overleaf.com and share with me. (This can be coupled with github if you wish to work offline, but remember that merging and resolving conflicts is then your job).
6. References - use Mendeley and insert PDFs of papers and comments on papers and share with the project team.
7. Documentation of code - README files in github are sometimes not enough ...  I'm happy with a linked google doc if it is more complex, but if you have time to learn github's augmented README file structure and are sure it will stand the test of time, feel free.
