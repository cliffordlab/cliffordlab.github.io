## Clifford Group website 

This document will explain where and how to perform common updates to Gari's group website.

## Get started

Before you edit this website, install RVM and Jekyll.

https://rvm.io/rvm/install  
https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/

> Note: you probably need to `brew install jekyll-seo-tag` too.

When editing the website, use `jekyll serve` to preview live from a local server before pushing changes. In Jekyll, Markdown is rendered into HTML in `_site/` files.

## Where to add content

+ Add new member data to `_data/members.yml`  
+ Add new member pics to `_site/assets/img`  
+ Update Alumni, Collaborators or Gari's bio in `__people/__`  
+ Update Info (onboarding) at `__info.md__`  
+ Update Ethics at ` __ethics.md__`  
+ Update Jobs Page at ` __jobs.md__`
