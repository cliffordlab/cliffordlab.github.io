## Our research

We work on signal processing, machine learning, and physiological modeling to
reduce costs, increase accuracy, and improve access in healthcare using high
frequency multivariate data streams.

Our theoretical developments focus on building confidence intervals and trust
metrics for predictive algorithms and scaling analysis of medical data beyond
conventional clinical capacity, particularly through mHealth.

Application areas include critical care, sleep and circadian rhythms,
perinatal monitoring, and resource-constrained environments such as developing
countries.
