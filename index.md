## What do we do?

We develop novel signal processing, machine learning, and physiological modeling techniques and apply them to high-frequency multivariate data streams using low-cost systems and edge computing. 
Our aim is to improve access to healthcare while reducing costs and energy consumption. 

Our research and application domains span cardiology, critical care, maternal-child health, digital psychiatry & neurology, and sleep & circadian rhythms. We have a strong focus on resource-limited settings and under-represented populations. You can find out more about specific projects/topics of interest <a href="https://gdclifford.info/research">here</a>. 

We also run the <a href="https://moody-challenge.physionet.org/about/">George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenges</a>, a series of open data science competitions, held annually since 2000, that aim to catalyze new open access benchmark health databases, and novel solutions to existing problems in healthcare and physiology.
