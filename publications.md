In this paper, we present a deep learning approach to identify patients at risk of developing NASH, given that they are suffering from NAFLD. For this, we created two sub cohorts within NASH (NASH suspected (NASH-S) and NASH biopsy-confirmed (NASH-B)) based on the availability of liver biopsy tests. We utilized medical codes from patient electronic medical records and augmented it with patient demographics to build a long short-term memory based NASH vs. NAFLD classifier. The model was trained and tested using five-fold cross-validation and compared with baseline models including XGBoost, random forest and logistic regression. An out-of-sample area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.61 was achieved in classifying NASH patients from NAFLD. When the same model was used to classify out-of-sample NASH-B cohort from NAFLD patients, a highest AUPRC of 0.53 was achieved which was better than other baseline methods.',    isbn = '978-3-030-53352-6',    doi = '10.1007/978-3-030-53352-6\_10',    url = 'https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-53352-6\_10'}">BibTeX entry</a> |
