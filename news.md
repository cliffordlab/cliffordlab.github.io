	<font size="5">The George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenge 2025 released the challenge results.</font>
 <br>
 	<em>September 2025</em> - Drs. Clifford, Reyna and Sameni have just returned from presenting the prizes at the conference Computing in Cardiology in São Paulo, Brazil, for <a href="https://moody-challenge.physionet.org/2025/">the George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenge 2025</a>, on the topic of Detection of Chagas disease from the ECG. This international competition (now in its 26th year) posts a unique set of public data and then challenges research and industry from around the world to address an unsolved problem in biomedical data science. Typically over 100 teams compete for almost 9 months, generating thousands of entries to solve the problem.  The Challenges are one of three specific aims of the world-renowned <a href="https://physionet.org/">PhysioNet Resource</a>, which has been continuously funded by the NIH since its inception in 1999. Emory has run the Challenges under Dr. Clifford’s leadership for over a decade, and jointly with Dr. Reyna since he joined the department 5 years ago.

 <br>
 	<em>September 2025</em> - Dr. Johann Vargas-Calixto,  a postdoctoral researcher working with Dr. Clifford, won the ‘Gary and Bill Sanders Best Poster Award’ at Computing in Cardiology in Brazil. His highly innovative poster entitled <a href="https://cinc.org/2025/Program/accepted/96_Preprint.pdf">‘Classification of the source of 1D Doppler ultrasound activity in fetal monitoring’</a> included a live demo using a bespoke app on a smartphone taped to the poster. Johann’s study aimed to develop an algorithm that automatically differentiates the sounds of fetal heart and umbilical cord pulses. Conference attendees who came to listen to the fetal Doppler signals could then try to guess their origin and see if their guesses were better than his automated AI approach. (Spoiler alert - they could not, by a long margin.) Results of this on-the-fly post-hoc experiment were then included in the final 4-page manuscript submitted in the conference proceedings.

 <br>
 	<em>September 2025</em> - Zuzana Koščová, a research scientist working with Dr. Clifford, was a runner up in the Young Investigator Award at Computing in Cardiology in Brazil for her work  <a href="https://cinc.org/2025/Program/accepted/291.pdf">“Predicting Ventricular Arrhythmias using Upstream Electrograms from Intracardiac Devices,”</a>. Ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) can lead to sudden cardiac death if not promptly managed. Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) typically deliver therapy after VA onset, leaving a limited window for intervention, and can lead to adverse effects such as inappropriate shocks. Her study investigates predicting VA onset using intracardiac electrograms (EGMs) up to 25 seconds before life-threatening VA. Her deep learning model achieved sensitivity of 96% and specificity of 98%. This approach could allow low-impact closed loop interventions (such as vagal stimulation) that could prevent VAs, and reduce the incidence of unpleasant and painful inappropriate shocks.

The safe+natal program equips Indigenous midwives with affordable monitoring technology, including smartphones, blood pressure cuffs, and ultrasound devices. This empowers midwives to monitor pregnancies, detect potential issues early, and connect expectant mothers with necessary follow-up care. 
<br>
The Google.org grant will expand the program's reach, placing AI tools in the hands of Indigenous Mayan midwives, potentially saving lives at a significant scale. Together with BMI faculty Dr. Nasim Katebi (who developed many of the AI algorithms as part of her PhD thesis) and Dr. Reza Sameni, the team will continue to develop and translate a series of AI-driven innovations into the hands of midwives in remote regions.
<br>
This collaboration is part of Google.org's $25 million philanthropic challenge, supporting projects that harness AI to advance progress towards the <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals">UN's Sustainable Development Goals</a>. Importantly, all 15 selected projects, including safe+natal, will be open-sourced to encourage further development and collaboration.

To assess whether the patient's condition is objectively improving, the doctor could ask him or her to take home a heart rate monitor and wear it continuously for 24 hours. An app connected to the monitor could then track how much the patient's heart rate varies over time and how much the patient moves. <a href="http://www.emoryhealthsciblog.com/big-data-with-heart-for-psychiatric-disorders">Read the article
