title: Ethics & Expectations

---

If you are in a class I am teaching or working with me, here is a
description of the standards by which I try to work (over and above
those required by my employer, host institutions and professional bodies
to which I belong). While I understand that different cultures have
different standards on issues such as plagiarism and authorship, I have
outlined a non-exhaustive acceptable set of practices below.

If you want to work with me, please email this page back to me with a
statement that you have read it and agree to try to stick to the
guidelines.

An interesting and readable article on these issues, can be found [in
the New
Yorker](http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2004/11/22/041122fa_fact?currentPage=all).
You can also find a guide to [Oxford’s Plagiarism Policy and
Disciplinary Procedures
here](http://www.softeng.ox.ac.uk/handbook/plagiarism.html). Note the
distinction between unintentional and deliberate plagiarism. While the
former is less egregious, it is still unacceptable, and should be
remedied immediately (in less than a week) on discovery. This doesn’t
avoid disciplinary action, but it may lessen the magnitude of the
repercussions.

## <a name="plagiarism"></a> Plagiarism and collusion

[Durham
University](http://www.dur.ac.uk/CompSci/ug/Plagiarism_tutorial/index.htm)
has a good definition of plagiarism and collusion:

“Plagiarism: unacknowledged quotations or close paraphrasing of other
people’s writing, amounting to the presentation of \[another\]
person’s thoughts or writings as one’s own. This includes material
which is available on the world-wide web and in any other electronic
form”.

This also includes algorithms and computer code, even if you are
translating them into another language. Of course, some algorithms are
so standard (such as the FFT) that they do not require citation,
although the specific implementation does require credit. From my point
of view, this is just good scientific practice, since not all FFTs are
the same. It’s important that the algorithm has been benchmarked and
the specific version is noted in case bugs are found later which
invalidate or weaken your conclusions.

[Durham
University](http://www.dur.ac.uk/CompSci/ug/Plagiarism_tutorial/index.htm)’s
definition of collusion is as follows:

\"Collusion: working with one or more other students to produce work
which is then presented as one’s own in a situation in which this is
inappropriate or not permitted and/or without acknowledging the
collaboration\".

Neither is acceptable. Even if you are working in teams, you must
describe who did what - see ’authorship’ below.

## Authorship

Many journals do not specify what constitutes authorship on a scientific
article. I think the \"Authors’ contributions\" section of [Biomedical
Engineering
Online](http://www.biomedical-engineering-online.com/info/instructions/)
provides an excellent description:

\"An ’author’ is generally considered to be someone who has made
substantive intellectual contributions to a published study. To qualify
as an author one should 1) have made substantial contributions to
conception and design, or acquisition of data, or analysis and
interpretation of data; 2) have been involved in drafting the manuscript
or revising it critically for important intellectual content; and 3)
have given final approval of the version to be published. Each author
should have participated sufficiently in the work to take public
responsibility for appropriate portions of the content. Acquisition of
funding, collection of data, or general supervision of the research
group, alone, does not justify authorship.

All contributors who do not meet the criteria for authorship should be
listed in an acknowledgements section. Examples of those who might be
acknowledged include a person who provided purely technical help,
writing assistance, or a department chair who provided only general
support.

List the source(s) of funding for the study, for each author, and for
the manuscript preparation in the acknowledgements section. Authors must
describe the role of the funding body, if any, in study design; in the
collection, analysis, and interpretation of data; in the writing of the
manuscript; and in the decision to submit the manuscript for
publication.\"

Different fields consider the subject of authorship in different manners
though. Clinical publications often carry authors who ’just’ collected
the data to provide sufficient credit for the enormous effort this
involves.

If you work in my research group you will be expected to co-author with
other researchers and academic or clinical staff. Unless the article is
in a completely unrelated discipline, you will be expected to pass all
potential publications to me before presenting in public, placing on any
website, submitting to a journal/conference/workshop etc, or
presenting/publishing in any public way. This is to protect the
professional reputations of all involved. If you wish to claim sole
authorship of a work (such as an article or patent), this will be
considered by myself in the first instance, and then if I disagree, by a
departmental committee.

Authorship order is often contentious. Generally the first author has to
contribute the majority of the intellectual input, work on the project,
and work in the manuscript and the senior (last) author is the person
who ran the project, designed a lot of the data collection and analysis.
The rest of the authors tend to get listed 2nd to N-1th in order of
contributions, although it’s not worth haggling about these positions.
This formula is not always true though. Although it’s a good idea to
set out authorship near the start of a project, this is not always done
or possible. The senior author/PI has the final word in assigning
authorship, although my general policy is to appoint a first author, and
ask them to draft author order based on their own perceptions of
contributions. It should be noted, however, the primary author must
continue to take the lead on research and publication throughout, even
throughout submission, review and final reporting. Faliure to do so will
mean first authorship is assigned to another author, who is willing to
step up, except in rare cases (such as serious illness during the later
stages - e.g. submission and review).

One caveat. If you do not answer emails in a reasonable period of time
(or leave a forwarding email), I may choose to publish some of your work
without your agreement. This is to ensure that our research progresses
despite your omission.

### Timing is everything

Once you’ve created your shortlist of authors, contact your supervisor
before the other authors, or if you are the PI on the study, the other
grant PI(s) and decide if you agree on the list. Resolve these
differences before involving all the authors. Err on the generous side
initially. Push disputes up the line, not sidewards to those uninvolved
in the process. This all needs to happen at least three weeks in advance
of any deadline. Any less is rude and doesn’t give time for those on
holiday to respond or check for the inevitable errors. Check your
contracts too - some research agreements require you to provide a draft
copy of the intended publication to the sponsor (particularly if the
research is partly or fully industry-sponsored) so that it can be
reviewed for patentability, trade secrets etc. In these cases you need
to start this process at least three weeks \*plus\* that review period
in advance of any deadline. If you work for me and don’t do this, then
I’ll refuse to let you submit. You do need your PI’s permission to
submit anything - their name is on this too (or should be), so they have
a right to a reasonable review time. If you have more than one
supervisor, go to the one who you consider would be the senior author,
but keep the other one in the loop, even if they are not an author.

## <a name="acknowledgements"></a> Acknowledgements and funding bodies

The following is from [Biomedical Engineering
Online](http://www.biomedical-engineering-online.com/info/instructions/)’s
instructions for authors:

> Anyone who contributed towards the study by making substantial
> contributions to conception, design, acquisition of data, or analysis
> and interpretation of data, or who was involved in drafting the
> manuscript or revising it critically for important intellectual content,
> but who does not meet the criteria for authorship should be named in an
> acknowledgements section. Please also include their source(s) of
> funding. Please also acknowledge anyone who contributed materials
> essential for the study. The role of a medical writer must be included
> in the acknowledgements section, including their source(s) of funding.
> Authors should obtain permission to acknowledge from all those mentioned
> in the Acknowledgements.

## <a name="references"></a> References, citations and ‘personal communications’

It is important that all (key) relevant materials are cited in your
publication. This includes anyone who’s work you have used, and any
work you have considered but rejected. When citing the work you should
be careful to indicate why you have used or rejected the material. Note
that if the source you cite is not primary, you need to cite the primary
source as well (or instead). Note, you cannot cite a paper to justify or
explain a technique which does little more than cite another paper to
justify or explain a technique. It is important that the format of the
references remains consistent. Although some journals require the
[Harvard](http://libweb.anglia.ac.uk/referencing/harvard.htm) style, I
prefer
[Vancouver](http://www.lib.monash.edu.au/tutorials/citing/vancouver.html).
The following is from [Biomedical Engineering
Online](http://www.biomedical-engineering-online.com/info/instructions/)’s
instructions for authors (and is the Vancouver style):

“All references must be numbered consecutively, in square brackets, in
the order in which they are cited in the text, followed by any in tables
or legends. Reference citations should not appear in titles or headings.
Each reference must have an individual reference number. Avoid excessive
referencing.

Only articles and abstracts that have been published or are in press, or
are available through public e-print/preprint servers, may be cited;
unpublished abstracts, unpublished data and personal communications
should not be included in the reference list, but may be included in the
text.

Obtaining permission to quote personal communications and unpublished
data from the cited author(s) is the responsibility of the author.
Journal abbreviations follow Index Medicus/MEDLINE. Citations in the
reference list should contain all named authors, regardless of how many
there are.

Web links and URLs should be included in the reference list.” They
should be provided in full, including both the title of the site and the
URL, an author (if known) and the date accessed (since the web is
ephemeral). Note that a thesis can be considered a peer-reviewed
publication to cite, but it is of little use if the thesis is not
readily available. If a paper exists, it is best to cite that instead
(or as well), or if the thesis is publicly available, then a URL can be
provided.

## <a name="irb"></a> IRB/Ethics approval

If your work involved living subjects other than yourself, you (or
whoever collected the data) must have obtained ethical approval for the
study. Again,
[BMEO](http://www.biomedical-engineering-online.com/info/instructions/)’s
policy provides an excellent guide which I paraphrase here:

Any experimental research that is reported in the manuscript must have
been performed with the approval of an appropriate ethics committee.
Research carried out on humans must be in compliance with the [Helsinki
Declaration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_Helsinki), and
any experimental research on animals must follow internationally
recognized guidelines. A statement to this effect is generally required
in the Methods section of the manuscript (particularly in medical
journals), including the name of the body which gave approval, with a
reference number where appropriate. Informed consent must also be
documented. Manuscripts may be rejected if the editorial office
considers that the research has not been carried out within an ethical
framework, e.g. if the severity of the experimental procedure is not
justified by the value of the knowledge gained.

The
[NHS](http://www.nres.npsa.nhs.uk/applications/approval-requirements/ethical-review-requirements/)
provides a quick lookup sheet
[here](http://www.nres.npsa.nhs.uk/EasySiteWeb/GatewayLink.aspx?alId=134016).
There appear to be some circumstances in which ethics approval is not
required, but you need to check the current / local rules and note that
IRB/ethics approval requirements change from time to time.

## <a name="double"></a> Double publishing

Any manuscripts submitted to a journal must not already have been
published in another journal or be under consideration by any other
journal, although it may have been deposited on a preprint server.
Manuscripts must not have already been published in any journal or other
citable form, with the exception that the journal is willing to consider
peer-reviewing manuscripts that are translations of articles originally
published in another language. In this case, the consent of the journal
in which the article was originally published must be obtained and the
fact that the article has already been published must be made clear on
submission and stated in the abstract. Manuscripts that are derived from
papers presented at conferences can be submitted unless they have been
published as part of the conference proceedings in a peer reviewed
journal. Authors are required to ensure that no material submitted as
part of a manuscript infringes existing copyrights, or the rights of a
third party.

You can take concepts from previous articles and develop them, or write
expanded versions of conference articles in some journals. It varies
from journal to journal and field to field. Medical journals, although
much more relaxed on authorship, generally don’t allow you to publish
any concept (in an expanded form or otherwise) that has previously been
published or presented at a conference.

## Copyright

See [Cal Tech’s resource](http://www.ogc.caltech.edu/forms/tutorial)
and [this article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_infringement)
for definitions and a discussion on how much you can borrow before you
are infringing on copyright. For example, you can photocopy or print a
certain percentage of many copyrighted journals or books for personal or
teaching use.

Some journals require you sign over your copyright to them. I would
discourage this practice. See this
[webcast](http://news-libraries.mit.edu/blog/podcast-abelson/1044/) of
Hal Abelson from MIT for a good justification on why we shouldn’t trade
our IP for relatively low up-front publishing costs. Other journals,
such as BioMedical Engineering OnLine allow authors to retain copyright
to their work for a slightly higher up-front publishing fee. Access then
is free, and you are more likely to be cited. [(Three times at the last
count.)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0040157)

More on Open Access Publishing can be found
[here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access_(publishing)).

## <a name="coi"></a> Conflicts of interest

The university of Oxford states: \"A conflict of interest arises where
the commitments and obligations owed by an individual member of staff or
student to the University or to other bodies, for example a funding
body, are likely to be compromised, or may appear to be compromised, by:

-   that person’s personal gain, or gain to immediate family (or a
    person with whom the person has a close personal relationship),
    whether financial or otherwise; or
-   the commitments and obligations that person owes to another person
    or body.

There can be situations in which the appearance of conflict of interest
is present even when no conflict actually exists. Thus it is important
for all staff and students when evaluating a potential conflict of
interest to consider how it might be perceived by others. The duty to
declare a possible conflict applies to the perception of the situation
rather than the actual existence of a conflict. However, the duty is not
infringed if the situation cannot reasonably be regarded as likely to
give rise to a conflict of interest. Conflicts of interest may be
financial or non-financial or both.\"

Further information about both types of conflict and Oxford
University’s conflict of interest policy can be found
[here](http://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/researchsupport/integrity/conflict/policy/).

Basically, if you know someone involved in a project that you could
influence or could influence you, or if a relative or friend is
financially connected with your research or publication, you need to
declare this. It doesn’t invalidate the study but not declaring this,
may cast significant suspicion on the research at a later date. Not
declaring interests may even lead to your employment or course of study
being terminated, amongst other repercussions.

## Patents

I’m not against patents. They are designed as a reward for publicly
disclosing an invention from which everyone can benefit (particularly
when the patent period ends). The incentive for this public disclosure
is a limited period of protection from competition. Patents also provide
incentives for investors to back research and companies that translate
the research into a practical product. As far as I am aware, nothing
stops you from developing research using patented material, in the same
way you can use any published material - you just can’t make money from
it, or let others use it, unless the patents are licensed.

However, patents can limit from where you can receive funding (because
of conflicts of interest). Patenting an idea may also disincentivize
others to work in this area, diminishing the impact of your research.
It’s also an expensive and time-consuming process unless someone else
is willing to do all the leg work for you (which is unlikely).

I am against bad patents, or arbitrary patenting of concepts on which
the inventor hasn’t spent much time or demonstrated the system works
well on more than a few examples.

If you want to patent something you are working on with me, please come
and see me to discuss this as early as possible. If you’ve already
published it, you can probably still patent it (in the US only up to 12
months from the initial public disclosure for as little as an intial
cost of \$100). Costs mount over time as you have to file a full patent
and probably use lawyers, and then a few years later start paying
maintenance costs.

## Source code and open source

Please DO NOT post any code you write that is related to research in our
department (or elsewhere) in a public repo. Use a private github repo in
the lab (not personal) github group.

There are many reasons for not posting code at an early stage:

1.  You agreed to the T&C’s of working with me
    [here](http://gdclifford.info/ethics#sharing)
2.  You are giving away your (and my) ideas to others so they can beat
    us to publication and grants. It literally risks our careers.
3.  It’s a work in progress so it’s likely to be wrong - you are doing
    a disservice to science
4.  It makes us look bad and harms our professional reputations
5.  It hasn’t been reviewed, so it’s probably contravening the
    licensing of the file, so odds are you’ve opened yourself up to
    legal action
6.  You’ve ruined any chance we can patent it. It’s a public
    disclosure.

Eventually your code will become public, but not until several of us
(including me) have reviewed it and I’ve signed off on it.

Most code you find online will carry a license with it. If it doesn’t,
it probably isn’t free and you shouldn’t use it. It’s hard to cite
it, but it still isn’t yours. Licenses vary in the extent to which you
can use, copy or embed them in other code, and often their licenses
require you to inherit their licenses (‘copyleft’). As Richard
Stallman will tell you, ‘free’ doesn’t mean free as in beer, it means
liberated, as in open to scrutiny, which is what science should be. You
can copyright your code, and license it to third parties, retaining
extensive rights for yourself and others. You can even patent code.

If you work in my research group, your code will probably inherit an
open source license and end up in the public domain. If you are unhappy
with this idea, let me know up front (N.B. You can still patent the idea
for which you have released open source code! If it is after you
publicly released the code, then only in the US - where you have 12
months to file a provisional or full patent.).

If you are confused about which free software license to use (and have
the liberty to choose), please see this [quick look-up
chart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_free_software_licenses).

Generally I want to open source code. I think it’s good for everyone
and certainly for scientific repeatability. Before posting anything
though please check with me. Also check:

1.  Any other authors who have made ‘substantial’ [\*](#ast) contributions
    (materially or intellectually) to the code are happy too. If they
    are not, let me know and I’ll adjudicate a reasonable timeline for
    posting. If you are unsure of authors, please contact me.
2.  The code doesn’t contain any passwords or PHI (whether you
    introduced it or not).
3.  The code has a list of authors, dates and open bugs, limitations,
    and is commented at each line to show specifically what is yours and
    when it was done. Notably, each source file should contain a header
    indicating the author(s), license, date of publication and date of
    last change (and what the conceptual change was - e.g. ‘minor bug
    fix to stop buffer overflow in zoom’, or ‘major redesign of
    annotation interface to allow zooming in x and y’ etc).
4.  A publication referring to the code is posted on the site where the
    code is located - probably in a readme file (so this means generally
    waiting until we’ve published at least one paper on the use of the
    code).
5.  Double check with Gari and let him know in an email that all the
    above steps have been done.

<a name="ast"></a>\* ‘Substantial’ is open to interpretation, but generally is along
the lines of publication authorship. This generally refers to other
researcher in my group or collaborators (but generally not people
helping with annotation or verbal comments on the design of the
interface, such as alpha or beta testers).

## <a name="presentations"></a> Presentations, conferences and other ‘publications’

Any presentation outside of our group meetings should be considered
’public’. This means you are presenting \*our\* research (not just
yours) and so you should send me your material intended for publication
(e.g. slides) well in advance (noting any other contributors prominently
in the material). Your research reflects the input of your collaborators
and so they should be aware of it in advance, and be given the chance to
correct errors or contradictions. You rarely work alone!

## <a name="sharing"></a> Sharing results before publication

You should talk to me before sharing research and results with other
groups or individuals. Generally I like to share and work in an ’open’
manner, but sometimes this can be sensitive. However, you may find that
I share your research with select colleagues without discussing this
with you first. I don’t expect to have to pre-approve every
communication I have with colleagues.

## <a name="expectations"></a> Working expectations

A DPhil / PhD is rather like working in a startup, or an apprenticeship.
You will do a bit of everything from data collection, to fixing
computers and entertaining visitors. Clearly a large part of your time
will be spent coding and writing up reports. As your supervisor I will
try to meet with you for an hour every other week - sometimes more,
sometimes less. I’ll respond to emails almost daily and I’ll expect
you to do the same, except during holidays. You can take your holidays
when you like, but let me know in advance if possible, just in case
there’s an important funder turning up.

As far as academic freedom goes, your independence is extremely
important, and you must plot your own course (to a large extent) through
your degree. However, your freedom cannot be unlimited for three main
reasons:

1.  Your funders usually have some restrictions, such as a particular
    focus area, an internship with a company, etc.
2.  You don’t work alone. You will be working in a group, and so you
    have to consider the needs of others, making sure your research
    doesn’t overlap too heavily.
3.  As you are putting your career in my hands, I am also putting my
    academic reputation in your hands, In that sense, it’s a 50:50
    relationship. If I am giving my time, then I will from time to time
    (but certainly not always) veto certain paths in your research which
    I am pretty sure will be fruitless. That’s my responsibility after
    all.

## <a name="attendance"></a> Attendance

I don’t have core hours, but I expect you to be in the office on
average 40 hours a week (or whatever your contract/agreement states)
Monday through Friday.

Try to be around 10am-3pm at least every day. It’s important you
communicate with the group for most of the day, are able to share
knowledge and absorb it to move quickly as a team. Research groups work
as a cascade of knowledge down the gradient of age (and often up). The
lifeblood of research is mentorship, and you will absorb lots in the
first year or so and then increasingly pay it forward to the incoming
cohorts. For that reason I don’t allow remote working, except on the
rare occasion.

Even if you are a student, and all your courses are over, you still must
be in the research group physically or you are wasting my time and
absorbing knowledge without paying it forward to the upcoming cohorts of
students. We stand on each other’s shoulders.

If you want to do a rotation with me, make sure your course load is low,
so you can spend sufficient time with my team to make it worth the
effort (on both sides).

It’s important you make any meeting I schedule and these might be early
morning or late afternoon because my collaborators are clinicians. The
flexibility goes both ways though \... if you decide you want to come in
at lunch time one day, good for you. I want you to work when you feel at
your best. Get sleep, work out, get good food, spend time with loved
ones. I hate presenteeism. Learn your own optimal times for working (but
balance it with the need to communicate with the group and have some
core hours on most days). If we do have a meeting though then I expect
you to be prompt at meetings.

I have a tight calendar, so if you are 10 minutes late to a meeting it
significantly impacts it. I’m pretty relaxed, but it results in a poor
impression on my collaborators.

It subconsciously sends the message that you think your time is more
important than theirs. I know - I can hear my family laughing at me.
I’m terribly guilty of this. I’m working on it myself. I’m sorry
about that, but please don’t copy me. I don’t role model time keeping
well.

Taking days off with holiday pay or flex time is fine with me but please
check in advance and drop it in the calendar so I don’t try to schedule
meetings with you or try to ask you a question while you are out.

## Correspondence

When you work as part of my team, you represent it. When you email
anyone, please try to be formal enough.

Use titles until they request that you don’t or have written back to
you (directly) using their first name only in the signature at least 3
times.

Use a signature in your email that correctly represents in which
research group you work.

Do not chat, instant/text message or cold call someone until they have
responded to the email and indicated this is OK.

If you chat me through any of my devices I’ll block you and be less
inclined to answer your emails because I find it intrusive.

I use chat/instant messenger type applications for colleagues (including
students) I know well. Please don’t leave me voice messages, as they
may take a while to reach me. If you want a meeting, please contact my
administrative assistant, and cc me on the email so I know who you are
and why you are requesting a meeting. I will then email my assistant
back to let her know the priority of the meeting. My assistant will not
make a meeting time for you without checking with me first.

## Recommendations

I only provide recommendations for students or employees/visitors who
have spent a substantial amount of time under my direct supervision,
either in class or as part of my group.

If you need a reference, please email me at least 4 weeks in advance to
ask me if I can do it. You may have to email me me a few times to
receive a response, as my volume of emails means I must triage my funded
projects and job responsibilities out to the top of the pile.

Please forgive me if I don’t respond. If you have emailed me three
times (5 days apart) and received no response, then I would strongly
advise looking for a more responsive human. If I do respond positively,
I need several pieces of information from you, described here.

First, please provide a **short** synopsis of the position for which you
are applying with a link to the opportunity on the web.

Brief and succinct emails help me respond quickly. Long emails are
triaged to the bottom of the pile, and those that require me to repeat
the information below or ask you for more detail (i.e. a short paragraph
describing the position, or a reminder of who you are \[sorry - I have
taught hundreds of students, and interact with thousands of people, so I
may not remember you immediately\]) will reduce the probability that I
respond.

If I respond positively (i.e. I feel I have the knowledge to provide a
strong reference and have the time), then I need you to provide me with
a draft letter.

Please provide a draft letter which indicates who am **I** (what makes
me so important that my reference means anything), how I know you and
our relationship, for how long (if less than a year, #months),
specifically what you did, how you performed, how well you ranked in the
class/your peers, any results/impact (give very specific examples that
illustrate the point), how well you take direction or respond to
criticism and mentorship, how well you work in a team and help others
out, why you left (if relevant), would I employ you if I had a relevant
position, how I view your potential to succeed, any other key
attributes/achievements that address the specific needs of the
post/chosen career.

If you are a student and want me to talk about your grades and/or
publications, please send readable digital versions.

Please add the full name, title and organisation (plus email) to whom
the reference should be addressed at the top of the draft (please don’t
make me hunt for it in an old email chain).

Provide the actual deadline (date and time in my local time zone) by
when I need to submit it.

Aim for 1-2 pages depending on the importance of the position. Brevity
is key, but don’t miss any of the points above! Please try to get this
to me at least 3 weeks before the deadline in case I’m travelling. It
takes about 1-2 hours to craft a good reference even with all this
information so I need to budget time.

Don’t worry about getting any details wrong - I’ll definitely be
changing them to reflect my realistic views on you. I’m English, so I
can’t be hyperbolic and over-effusive in your reference, and I’ll
delete any exaggerations, so please be truthful and balanced (but not
modest) and it’ll save us all time. I’ll note my cultural bias (to
under- rather than over-state) so the reader knows how to normalise your
reference against the other ludicrous ‘future world leader’ references
they receive).

Please note that you must waive your right to access the reference I
write for you. (Most referees will require this, so I suggest you do
this for all of your referees.) I’m not willing to spend time haggling
over the nuances of a reference. I will most likely have already
discussed it with you in detail if you took the initiative to provide me
a draft. I am likely to tell you before hand if the reference will be
poor, and suggest you find another referee. Of course, you should not
request a reference from someone who does not know you well. Try to
cultivate and maintain relationships with three or more mentors you know
well. They will be key for written support. Try also to ensure that they
have supervised you closely for a significant period of time and were in
a senior position to you. A current / most recent direct supervisor is
important. A mix of direct supervisors and senior thought leaders is
very useful. When you contact them for a reference, send them a copy of
the last reference they wrote for you (if they shared it), and ask them
if they would like you to highlight anything in your CV that directly
pertains to the application. If you can’t identify this information
yourself then you are not going to fare well in the interview.
