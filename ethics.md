My leadership and mentorship philosophy can be found [here](https://gdclifford.info/ethos.html).

If you are in a class I am teaching or working with me, here is a
description of the standards by which I try to work (over and above
those required by my employer, host institutions and professional bodies
to which I belong). While I understand that different cultures have
different behavioral standards on issues such as plagiarism and authorship, 
I have outlined a non-exhaustive acceptable set of practices below.

If you want to work with me, please email this page back to me with a
statement that you have read it and agree to try to stick to the
guidelines.

I've also added some information on what you can expect when working
in my research group. If you have any suggestions for changes, let me know.

An interesting and readable article on these issues, can be found [in
the New
Yorker](http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2004/11/22/041122fa_fact?currentPage=all).
You can also find a guide to [Oxford’s Plagiarism Policy and
Disciplinary Procedures
here](http://www.softeng.ox.ac.uk/handbook/plagiarism.html). Note the
distinction between unintentional and deliberate plagiarism. While the
former is less egregious, it is still unacceptable, and should be
remedied immediately (in less than a week) on discovery. This doesn’t
avoid disciplinary action, but it may lessen the magnitude of the
repercussions.

## <a name="plagiarism"></a> Plagiarism and collusion

[Durham
University](http://www.dur.ac.uk/CompSci/ug/Plagiarism_tutorial/index.htm)
has a good definition of plagiarism and collusion:

“Plagiarism: unacknowledged quotations or close paraphrasing of other
people’s writing, amounting to the presentation of \[another\]
person’s thoughts or writings as one’s own. This includes material
which is available on the world-wide web and in any other electronic
form”.

This also includes algorithms and computer code, even if you are
translating them into another language. Of course, some algorithms are
so standard (such as the FFT) that they do not require citation,
although the specific implementation does require credit. From my point
of view, this is just good scientific practice, since not all FFTs are
the same. It’s important that the algorithm has been benchmarked and
the specific version is noted in case bugs are found later which
invalidate or weaken your conclusions.

[Durham
University](http://www.dur.ac.uk/CompSci/ug/Plagiarism_tutorial/index.htm)’s
definition of collusion is as follows:

\"Collusion: working with one or more other students to produce work
which is then presented as one’s own in a situation in which this is
inappropriate or not permitted and/or without acknowledging the
collaboration\".

Neither is acceptable. Even if you are working in teams, you must
describe who did what - see ’authorship’ below.

## Authorship

Many journals do not specify what constitutes authorship on a scientific
article. I think the \"Authors’ contributions\" section of [Biomedical
Engineering
Online](http://www.biomedical-engineering-online.com/info/instructions/)
provides an excellent description:

\"An ’author’ is generally considered to be someone who has made
substantive intellectual contributions to a published study. To qualify
as an author one should 1) have made substantial contributions to
conception and design, or acquisition of data, or analysis and
interpretation of data; 2) have been involved in drafting the manuscript
or revising it critically for important intellectual content; and 3)
have given final approval of the version to be published. Each author
should have participated sufficiently in the work to take public
responsibility for appropriate portions of the content. Acquisition of
funding, collection of data, or general supervision of the research
group, alone, does not justify authorship.

All contributors who do not meet the criteria for authorship should be
listed in an acknowledgements section. Examples of those who might be
acknowledged include a person who provided purely technical help,
writing assistance, or a department chair who provided only general
support.

List the source(s) of funding for the study, for each author, and for
the manuscript preparation in the acknowledgements section. Authors must
describe the role of the funding body, if any, in study design; in the
collection, analysis, and interpretation of data; in the writing of the
manuscript; and in the decision to submit the manuscript for
publication.\"

Different fields consider the subject of authorship in different manners
though. Clinical publications often carry authors who ’just’ collected
the data to provide sufficient credit for the enormous effort this
involves.

If you work in my research group you will be expected to co-author with
other researchers and academic or clinical staff. Unless the article is
in a completely unrelated discipline, you will be expected to pass all
potential publications to me before presenting in public, placing on any
website, submitting to a journal/conference/workshop, etc., or
presenting/publishing in any public way. This is to protect the
professional reputations of all involved. If you wish to claim sole
authorship of a work (such as an article or patent), this will be
considered by myself in the first instance, and then if I disagree, by a
departmental committee.

Authorship order is often contentious. Generally, the first author has to
contribute the majority of the intellectual input, work on the project,
and work in the manuscript and the senior (last) author is the person
who ran the project, designed a lot of the data collection and analysis.
The rest of the authors tend to get listed 2nd to N-1th in order of
contributions, although it’s not worth haggling about these positions.
This formula is not always true though. Although it’s a good idea to
set out authorship near the start of a project, this is not always done
or possible. The senior author/PI has the final word in assigning
authorship, although my general policy is to appoint a first author, and
ask them to draft author order based on their own perceptions of
contributions. It should be noted, however, the primary author must
continue to take the lead on research and publication throughout, even
throughout submission, review and final reporting. Failure to do so will
mean first authorship is assigned to another author, who is willing to
step up, except in rare cases (such as serious illness during the later
stages - e.g., submission and review).

One caveat. If you do not answer emails in a reasonable period of time
(or leave a forwarding email), I may choose to publish some of your work
without your agreement. This is to ensure that our research progresses
despite your omission.

### Timing is everything

Once you’ve created your shortlist of authors, contact your supervisor
before contacting the other authors, or if you are the PI on the study, the other
grant PI(s) and decide if you agree on the list. Resolve these
differences before involving all the authors. Err on the generous side
initially. Push disputes up the line, not sideways to those uninvolved
in the process. This all needs to happen at least three weeks in advance
of any deadline. Any less is thoughtless and doesn’t give time for those on
holiday to respond or check for the inevitable errors. Check your
contracts too - some research agreements require you to provide a draft
copy of the intended publication to the sponsor (particularly if the
research is partly or fully industry-sponsored) so that it can be
reviewed for patentability, trade secrets, etc. In these cases, you need
to start this process at least three weeks \*plus\* that review period
in advance of any deadline. If you work for me and don’t do this, then
I’ll refuse to let you submit. You do need your PI’s permission to
submit anything - their name is on this too (or should be), so they have
a right to a reasonable review time. If you have more than one
supervisor, go to the one who you consider would be the senior author,
but keep the other one in the loop, even if they are not an author.

## <a name="acknowledgements"></a> Acknowledgements and funding bodies

The following is from [Biomedical Engineering
Online](http://www.biomedical-engineering-online.com/info/instructions/)’s
instructions for authors:

> Anyone who contributed towards the study by making substantial
> contributions to conception, design, acquisition of data, or analysis
> and interpretation of data, or who was involved in drafting the
> manuscript or revising it critically for important intellectual content,
> but who does not meet the criteria for authorship should be named in an
> acknowledgements section. Please also include their source(s) of
> funding. Please also acknowledge anyone who contributed materials
> essential for the study. The role of a medical writer must be included
> in the acknowledgements section, including their source(s) of funding.
> Authors should obtain permission to acknowledge from all those mentioned
> in the Acknowledgements.

## <a name="references"></a> References, citations and ‘personal communications’

It is important that all (key) relevant materials are cited in your
publication. This includes anyone who’s work you have used, and any
work you have considered but rejected. When citing the work, you should
be careful to indicate why you have used or rejected the material. Note
that if the source you cite is not primary, you need to cite the primary
source as well (or instead). Note, you cannot cite a paper to justify or
explain a technique that does little more than cite another paper to
justify or explain a technique. It is important that the format of the
references remain consistent. Although some journals require the
[Harvard](http://libweb.anglia.ac.uk/referencing/harvard.htm) style, I
prefer
[Vancouver](http://www.lib.monash.edu.au/tutorials/citing/vancouver.html).
The following is from [Biomedical Engineering
Online](http://www.biomedical-engineering-online.com/info/instructions/)’s
instructions for authors (and is the Vancouver style):

“All references must be numbered consecutively, in square brackets, in
the order in which they are cited in the text, followed by any in tables
or legends. Reference citations should not appear in titles or headings.
Each reference must have an individual reference number. Avoid excessive
referencing.

Only articles and abstracts that have been published or are in press, or
are available through public e-print/preprint servers, may be cited;
unpublished abstracts, unpublished data and personal communications
should not be included in the reference list, but may be included in the
text.

Obtaining permission to quote personal communications and unpublished
data from the cited author(s) is the responsibility of the author.
Journal abbreviations follow Index Medicus/MEDLINE. Citations in the
reference list should contain all named authors, regardless of how many
there are.

Web links and URLs should be included in the reference list.” They
should be provided in full, including both the title of the site and the
URL, an author (if known), and the date accessed (since the web is
ephemeral). Note that a thesis can be considered a peer-reviewed
publication to cite, but it is of little use if the thesis is not
readily available. If a paper exists, it is best to cite that instead
(or as well), or if the thesis is publicly available, then a URL can be
provided.

## <a name="irb"></a> IRB/Ethics approval

If your work involved living subjects other than yourself, you (or
whoever collected the data) must have obtained ethical approval for the
study. Again,
[BMEO](http://www.biomedical-engineering-online.com/info/instructions/)’s
policy provides an excellent guide, which I paraphrase here:

Any experimental research that is reported in the manuscript must have
been performed with the approval of an appropriate ethics committee.
Research carried out on humans must be in compliance with the [Helsinki
Declaration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_Helsinki), and
any experimental research on animals must follow internationally
recognized guidelines. A statement to this effect is generally required
in the Methods section of the manuscript (particularly in medical
journals), including the name of the body that gave approval, with a
reference number where appropriate. Informed consent must also be
documented. Manuscripts may be rejected if the editorial office
considers that the research has not been carried out within an ethical
framework, e.g., if the severity of the experimental procedure is not
justified by the value of the knowledge gained.

The
[NHS]([http://www.nres.npsa.nhs.uk/applications/approval-requirements/ethical-review-requirements/](https://www.hra.nhs.uk/approvals-amendments/what-approvals-do-i-need/research-ethics-committee-review/))
provides a quick lookup sheet
[here](https://web.archive.org/web/20111108164156/http://www.nres.npsa.nhs.uk/EasysiteWeb/getresource.axd?AssetID=134016&type=full&servicetype=Attachment).
There appear to be some circumstances in which ethics approval is not
required, but you need to check the current/local rules and note that
IRB/ethics approval requirements change from time to time.

## <a name="double"></a> Double publishing

Any manuscripts submitted to a journal must not already have been
published in another journal or under consideration by any other
journal, although it may have been deposited on a preprint server.
Manuscripts must not have already been published in any journal or other
citable form, with the exception that the journal is willing to consider
peer-reviewing manuscripts that are translations of articles originally
published in another language. In this case, the consent of the journal
in which the article was originally published must be obtained, and the
fact that the article has already been published must be made clear on
submission and stated in the abstract. Manuscripts that are derived from
papers presented at conferences can be submitted unless they have been
published as part of the conference proceedings in a peer-reviewed
journal. Authors are required to ensure that no material submitted as
part of a manuscript infringes existing copyrights, or the rights of a
third party.

You can take concepts from previous articles and develop them, or write
expanded versions of conference articles in some journals. It varies
from journal to journal and field to field. Medical journals, although
much more relaxed on authorship, generally don’t allow you to publish
any concept (in an expanded form or otherwise) that has previously been
published or presented at a conference.

## Copyright

See [Cal Tech’s resource](http://www.ogc.caltech.edu/forms/tutorial)
and [this article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_infringement)
for definitions and a discussion on how much you can borrow before you
are infringing on copyright. For example, you can photocopy or print a
certain percentage of many copyrighted journals or books for personal or
teaching use.

Some journals require you to sign over your copyright to them. I would
discourage this practice. See this
[webcast](http://news-libraries.mit.edu/blog/podcast-abelson/1044/) of
Hal Abelson from MIT for a good justification on why we shouldn’t trade
our IP for relatively low up-front publishing costs. Other journals,
such as BioMedical Engineering OnLine allow authors to retain copyright
to their work for a slightly higher up-front publishing fee. Access then
is free, and you are more likely to be cited. [(Three times at the last
count.)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0040157)

## <a name="coi"></a> Conflicts of interest

The university of Oxford states: \"A conflict of interest arises where
the commitments and obligations owed by an individual member of staff or
student to the University or to other bodies, for example a funding
body, are likely to be compromised, or may appear to be compromised, by:

-   that person’s personal gain, or gain to immediate family (or a
    person with whom the person has a close personal relationship),
    whether financial or otherwise; or
-   the commitments and obligations that person owes to another person
    or body.

There can be situations in which the appearance of conflict of interest
is present even when no conflict actually exists. Thus, it is important
for all staff and students when evaluating a potential conflict of
interest to consider how it might be perceived by others. The duty to
declare a possible conflict applies to the perception of the situation
rather than the actual existence of a conflict. However, the duty is not
infringed if the situation cannot reasonably be regarded as likely to
give rise to a conflict of interest. Conflicts of interest may be
financial or non-financial or both.\"

Further information about both types of conflict and Oxford
University’s conflict of interest policy can be found
[here](http://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/researchsupport/integrity/conflict/policy/).

Basically, if you know someone involved in a project that you could
influence or could influence you, or if a relative or friend is
financially connected with your research or publication, you need to
declare this. It doesn’t invalidate the study but not declaring this,
may cast significant suspicion on the research at a later date. Not
declaring interests may even lead to your employment or course of study
being terminated, amongst other repercussions.

## Patents

I’m not against patents. They are designed as a reward for publicly
disclosing an invention from which everyone can benefit (particularly
when the patent period ends). The incentive for this public disclosure
is a limited period of protection from competition. Patents also provide
incentives for investors to back research and companies that translate
the research into a practical product. As far as I am aware, nothing
stops you from developing research using patented material, in the same
way you can use any published material - you just can’t make money from
it, or let others use it, unless the patents are licensed.

However, patents can limit from where you can receive funding (because
of conflicts of interest). Patenting an idea may also disincentivize
others to work in this area, diminishing the impact of your research.
It’s also an expensive and time-consuming process unless someone else
is willing to do all the legwork for you (which is unlikely).

I am against bad patents, or arbitrary patenting of concepts on which
the inventor hasn’t spent much time or demonstrated that the system works
well on more than a few examples.

If you want to patent something you are working on with me, please come
and see me to discuss this as early as possible. If you’ve already
published it, you can probably still patent it (in the US, only up to 12
months from the initial public disclosure for as little as an initial
cost of \$100). Costs mount over time as you have to file a full patent
and probably use lawyers, and then a few years later, start paying
maintenance costs.

## Source code and open-source

Please DO NOT post any code you write that is related to research in our
department (or elsewhere) in a public repo. Use a private Github repo in
the lab (not personal) Github group.

There are many reasons for not posting code at an early stage:

1.  You agreed to the T&C’s of working with me
    [here](http://gdclifford.info/ethics#sharing)
2.  You are giving away your (and my) ideas to others so they can beat
    us to publication and grants. It literally risks our careers.
3.  It’s a work in progress, so it’s likely to be wrong - you are doing
    a disservice to science
4.  It makes us look bad and harms our professional reputations
5.  It hasn’t been reviewed, so it’s probably contravening the
    licensing of the file, so odds are you’ve opened yourself up to
    legal action
6.  You’ve ruined any chance we can patent it. It’s a public
    disclosure.

Eventually your code will become public, but not until several of us
(including me) have reviewed it and I’ve signed off on it.

Most code you find online will carry a license with it. If it doesn’t,
it probably isn’t free, and you shouldn’t use it. It’s hard to cite
it, but it still isn’t yours. Licenses vary in the extent to which you
can use, copy, or embed them in other code, and often their licenses
require you to inherit their licenses (‘copyleft’). As Richard
Stallman will tell you, ‘free’ doesn’t mean free as in beer, it means
liberated, as in open to scrutiny, which is what science should be. You
can copyright your code and license it to third parties, retaining
extensive rights for yourself and others. You can even patent code.

If you work in my research group, your code will probably inherit an
open-source license and end up in the public domain. If you are unhappy
with this idea, let me know up front. N.B. You can still patent the idea
for which you have released open-source code! If it is after you
publicly released the code, then only in the US - where you have 12
months to file a provisional or full patent.

If you are confused about which free software license to use (and have
the liberty to choose), please see this [quick look-up
chart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_free_software_licenses).

Generally, I want to open-source code. I think it’s good for everyone
and certainly for scientific repeatability. Before posting anything
though please check with me. Also check:

1.  Any other authors who have made ‘substantial’ [\*](#ast) contributions
    (materially or intellectually) to the code are happy too. If they
    are not, let me know and I’ll adjudicate a reasonable timeline for
    posting. If you are unsure of the authors, please contact me.
2.  The code doesn’t contain any passwords or PHI (whether you
    introduced it or not).
3.  The code has a list of authors, dates and open bugs, limitations,
    and is commented at each line to show specifically what is yours, and
    when it was done. Notably, each source file should contain a header
    indicating the author(s), license, date of publication and date of
    last change, and what the conceptual change was - e.g. ‘minor bug
    fix to stop buffer overflow during zoom’, or ‘major redesign of
    annotation interface to allow zooming in x and y’, etc.
4.  A publication referring to the code is posted on the site where the
    code is located - probably in a readme file (so this means generally
    waiting until we’ve published at least one paper on the use of the
    code).
5.  Double check with me, and let me know in an email that all the
    above steps have been done.

<a name="ast"></a>\* ‘Substantial’ is open to interpretation, but generally is along
the lines of publication authorship. This generally refers to other
researcher in my group or collaborators (but generally not people
helping with annotation or verbal comments on the design of the
interface, such as alpha or beta testers).

## <a name="presentations"></a> Presentations, conferences and other ‘publications’

Any presentation outside of our group meetings should be considered
’public’. This means you are presenting \*our\* research (not just
yours) and so you should send me your material intended for publication
(e.g. slides) well in advance (noting any other contributors prominently
in the material). Your research reflects the input of your collaborators
and so they should be aware of it in advance, and be given the chance to
correct errors or contradictions. You rarely work alone!

## <a name="sharing"></a> Sharing results before publication

You should talk to me before sharing research and results with other
groups or individuals. Generally, I like to share and work in an ’open’
manner, but sometimes this can be sensitive. However, you may find that
I share your research with select colleagues without discussing this
with you first. I don’t expect to have to pre-approve every
communication I have with colleagues.

## <a name="expectations"></a> Work environment/expectations

Graduate study is rather like working in a startup or an apprenticeship.
You may do a bit of everything from data collection to fixing
computers and entertaining visitors. Clearly, a large part of your time
will be spent coding and writing up reports. As your supervisor I will
try to meet with you for an hour every other week - sometimes more,
sometimes less. You'll see me in group meetings much more often, except
when I'm traveling or I'm on holiday. I’ll respond to emails almost daily, 
and I’ll expect you to do the same, except during holidays and weekends. 
I often miss emails (extreme inbox overload), so don't be afraid to email
me a few times to remind me. Generally, I'm really flexible about vacation 
time and I want you to take your holidays when you like or when you most 
need them ... your mental (and physical) health is the most important
part of your development, and if you don't take breaks, you will burn out.

Please let me know when you plan to leave well in advance, just in case
there’s an important visitor turning up or we have critical deadlines.
Make sure your shared calendar clearly indicates you are out of office ..
please don't expect me to remember when you said you would be away.

As far as academic freedom goes, your independence is extremely
important, and you must plot your own course (to a large extent) through
your research. However, your freedom cannot be unlimited for three main
reasons:

1.  Your funders usually have some restrictions, such as a particular
    focus area, an internship with a company, etc.
2.  You don’t work alone. You will be working in a group, and so you
    have to consider the needs of others, making sure your research
    dovetails and doesn’t overlap too heavily.
3.  As you are putting your career in my hands, I am also putting my
    academic reputation in your hands. In that sense, it’s an equal
    partnership. If I am giving my time, then I will occasionally
    (but certainly not always) veto certain paths in your research, which
    I am pretty sure will be fruitless. That’s my responsibility after
    all. I won't always be right, but I'm likely to be right more
    often than I'm wrong. Ultimately, the buck stops with me, and I
    have to justify our choices to the funding entities, so it's my
    duty and prerogative to make these calls.

## <a name="attendance"></a> Attendance and well-being

First, your health is the most important thing. If you aren't looking
after yourself, then your health, home life, and work will suffer.
Don't come to work if you feel sick. Work remotely, or take a rest.
You'll find it's more efficient in the long run, and you will also 
keep others safe. If you feel you have to come in, but are not feeling
100%, please wear a well-fitting N95 mask (we provide them for free)
and be extra attentive about hand washing. 
Unless you can't physically manage it, please let your direct report
that you are out sick as soon as safely possible, and if you feel you 
can, send materials to others so they can pick up where you left off.
(In general, you should make sure that your work is backed up daily and
shared with someone who can pick up where you left off on any given day
- so your documentation should be high quality.) 

A typical full-time research position should require about 40 hours of
focused work each week. If you are part-time (e.g., you have classes to
take), please be clear about what hours you can do. It's important to
set expectations. If you want to do a rotation in another lab at the
same time as my lab, let me know well in advance. We will need to
discuss this carefully. Usually, it's a bad idea - you cannot give
enough time to either lab, and you will probably fail both. It's best
to immerse yourself in one lab culture at a time.

While you are not our sick, in general I expect you to be in the office 
at least 25 hours a week (or whatever your contract/agreement states), 
Monday through Friday. I'm open to occasional remote work, especially if 
you have any caregiving or health issues, but we need to discuss it and make 
sure it fits with the other team members' schedules. Optimizing interactions 
between research team members is important to a functional project/lab.
It's very rare that we are working in isolation at any point in our careers.

Try to be around 10 am to 3 pm at least 3-4 days a week (unless your visa or
contract requires more than this, or you feel like being in the office 
more often. It’s important you communicate regularly and rapidly with 
the other lab members for most of the working week, and you are able to 
share knowledge and absorb it to move quickly as a team. Research groups 
function best when they cascade knowledge down the gradient of age 
(and sometimes up the age gradient). The lifeblood of research is mentorship, 
and you will absorb lots in the first year or so and then increasingly pay 
it forward to the incoming cohorts. It's very hard to mentor remotely, 
with the exception of very long-term research staff, and almost everyone 
comes in person multiple times a week.

Even if you are a student, and all your courses are over, you should still
be physically present so that you can contribute to the 
upcoming cohorts of students. We stand on each other’s shoulders.

If you want to do a rotation with me, make sure your course load is 
manageably low, so you can spend sufficient time with my team to make it 
worth the effort (on both sides). This will also help you avoid burn-out.

It’s important you attend any meeting I schedule with you (individually and 
in teams) and you turn up before the meeting starts. 
Meetings sometimes take place early in the morning (although not if I can help it)
or late afternoon because my collaborators are clinicians, or are located in 
time zones across the world. 
The flexibility goes both ways, though \... if you decide you want to come in
at lunch time one day, good for you. I want you to work when you feel at
your best. Get sleep, work out, eat good food, and spend time with loved
ones. I see no point in presenteeism. Learn your own optimal times 
for working (but balance it with the need to communicate with the group 
and have some core hours on most days). 

If we do have a meeting, then I expect you to be prepared, with notes from 
the last meeting, to take (and share) new notes, and to be prompt.
I have a tight calendar, so if you are late to a meeting, it can 
significantly impact utility. I’m pretty relaxed, but even minor
tardiness results in a poor impression on my collaborators. It can even 
lead to a loss of funding and impaired reputation. Tardiness
sends a subconscious message that you think your time is more
important than others' time. I know - I can hear my family laughing at me.
I’m terribly guilty of this. But I've worked on that, and if I'm late, it's
because the previous meeting ran over (against my will). I am guilty of 
letting meetings run over, but that's because people often don't bring up
critical issues until 3 minutes to the hour. I don’t role model time keeping
well, so don't copy me. This is one reason I need you to help me. Don't 
be afraid to point out that the meeting is about to finish and we need 
to move on to the next one.

Taking days off with holiday pay or flex time is fine with me, but please
check in advance and drop it in the calendar so I don’t try to schedule
meetings with you or try to ask you a question while you are out. As noted
above, generally, I'm really flexible about vacation time and I want you 
to take your holidays when you like or when you most need them ... your 
mental (and physical) health is the most important part of your development, 
and if you don't take real breaks, you will burn out. Holidays give you 
a good perspective on your work and career.

## Correspondence and communication

Communication is the most important aspect of research. We work as a 
group, and communicating what you are doing, any roadblocks, and 
timelines to the people who depend on your work (including supervisors 
and project managers) is essential. In general, you should check your email 
3-4 times a day to look out for urgent issues that would benefit from a 
response in 1-2 hours. Most emails should be answered within 24 hours
of receiving them. (I receive too many emails to do this, but as you
are working on 1 or 2 specific projects, you should be able to deal with 
the volume of emails - if you can't, let me know immediately.)

External correspondence is different. When you work as part of my team, 
you represent it. When you communicate with anyone, please try to be formal enough.
Use titles until they request that you don’t or have written back to
you (directly) using their first name only in the signature at least 3
times.

Use a signature in your email that correctly represents in which
research group you work.

Do not chat, instant/text message or cold call someone until they have
responded to the email and indicated this is OK.

If you initiate a chat with me through social media, I’ll probably accidentally 
ignore it for many months, I may block you when I see it, and may be less 
inclined to answer your emails because I find instant messaging intrusive. 
My research group knows when to chat me (e.g., on an urgent topic that might 
result in harm to my projects, or a missed opportunity for their careers).

I use chat/instant messenger type applications for colleagues (including
students) I know well. Please don’t leave me voice messages, as they
may take a while to reach me. If you want a meeting, please contact my
administrative assistant, and cc me on the email so I know who you are
and why you are requesting a meeting. I will then email my assistant
back to let her know the priority of the meeting. My assistant will not
make a meeting time for you without checking with me first.

Posting on social media or other public forums. My advice is - don't - 
it's usually a mistake. Please do not post information about your research or 
lab activities without clearing it with me first. It could cause issues
with IP, contracts, future publications, or funding.

## Recommendations

I only provide recommendations for students or employees/visitors who
have spent a substantial amount of time under my direct supervision,
either in class or as part of my group.

If you need a reference, please email me at least 4 weeks in advance to
ask me if I can do it. You may have to email me a few times to
receive a response, as my volume of emails means I must triage my funded
projects and job responsibilities out to the top of the pile.

Please forgive me if I don’t respond. If you have emailed me three
times (5 days apart) and received no response, then I would strongly
advise looking for a more responsive human. If I do respond positively,
I need several pieces of information from you: 

First, please provide a **short** synopsis of the position for which you
are applying with a link to the opportunity on the web.

Brief and succinct emails help me respond quickly. Long emails are
triaged to the bottom of the pile, and those that require me to repeat
the information below or ask you for more detail (i.e. a short paragraph
describing the position, or a reminder of who you are \[sorry - I have
taught hundreds of students, and interact with thousands of people, so I
may not remember you immediately\]) will reduce the probability that I
respond.

If I respond positively (i.e. I feel I have the knowledge to provide a
strong reference and have the time), then I need you to provide me with
a draft letter.

Please provide a draft letter which indicates who am **I** (what makes
me so important that my reference means anything), how I know you and
our relationship, for how long (if less than a year, #months),
specifically what you did, how you performed, how well you ranked in the
class/your peers, any results/impact (give very specific examples that
illustrate the point), how well you take direction or respond to
criticism and mentorship, how well you work in a team and help others
out, why you left (if relevant), would I employ you if I had a relevant
position, how I view your potential to succeed, any other key
attributes/achievements that address the specific needs of the
post/chosen career.

If you are a student and want me to talk about your grades and/or
publications, please send readable digital versions of your transcripts
and/or publications.

Please add the full name, title and organisation (plus email) to whom
the reference should be addressed at the top of the draft (please don’t
make me hunt for it in an old email chain).

Provide the actual deadline (date and time in my local time zone) by
when I need to submit it.

Aim for 1-2 pages, depending on the importance of the position. Brevity
is key, but don’t miss any of the points above! Please try to get this
to me at least 3 weeks before the deadline in case I’m travelling. It
takes about 1-2 hours to craft a good reference, even with all this
information, so I need to budget time.

Don’t worry about getting any details wrong - I’ll definitely be
changing them to reflect my realistic views on you. I’m English, so I
can’t be hyperbolic and over-effusive in your reference, and I’ll
delete any exaggerations, so please be truthful and balanced (but not
modest) and it’ll save us all time. I may note my cultural bias (to
under- rather than over-state) so the reader knows how to normalise your
reference against the other hyperbolic ‘future world leader’ references
they receive).

Please note that you must waive your right to access the reference I
write for you. (Most referees will require this, so I suggest you do
this for all of your referees.) I’m not able to spend time haggling
over the nuances of a reference. I will most likely have already
discussed it with you in detail if you took the initiative to provide me
a draft. I am likely to tell you beforehand if the reference will be
poor, and suggest you find another referee. Of course, you should not
request a reference from someone who does not know you well. Try to
cultivate and maintain relationships with three or more mentors you know
well. They will be key for written support. Try also to ensure that they
have supervised you closely for a significant period of time and were in
a senior position to you. A current / most recent direct supervisor is
important. A mix of direct supervisors and senior thought leaders is
very useful. When you contact them for a reference, send them a copy of
the last reference they wrote for you (if they shared it), and ask them
if they would like you to highlight anything in your CV that directly
pertains to the application. If you can’t identify this information
yourself, then you are not going to fare well in the interview.
