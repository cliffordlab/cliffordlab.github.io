		<h2>Our research</h2>
		<p>We work on signal processing, machine learning, and physiological modeling to reduce costs, increase accuracy, and improve access in healthcare using enormous, high frequency, and multivariate data streams.</p>
		<p>Theoretical techniques focus on building confidence intervals and trust metrics for predictive algorithms and scaling analysis of medical data beyond conventional clinical capacity.</p>
		<p>Application areas include critical care, sleep and circadian rhythms, perinatal monitoring, and resource-constrained environments such as developing countries.</p>
